# Integration-Testing-with-jest


Integration Testing is sometimes called ‘I & T’ (Integration and Testing), ‘String Testing’ or ‘Thread Testing’. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between modules when they are integrated.

unit tests (single isolated unit test) testing functions with additional dependencies (one function calls another), and E2E testing (End to end or user interface testing).
