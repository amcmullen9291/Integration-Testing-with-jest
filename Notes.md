 # Notes

You will have a test runner (ie mocha or jest), an assertion library to define expectations (like Chai), and a Headless browser (mostly used for end to end testing)


the "test" script  "jest --watch"  watches for changes in your app (without having to restart the server. You may have to press 'a' to start the active watching)
